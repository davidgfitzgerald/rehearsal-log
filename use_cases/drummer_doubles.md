## Use Case: Better Drummer Doubles

I am a drummer who wishes to get better double strokes (faster, better timing, consistent velocity).

To achieve this with the Rehearsal Log app I require the following:

#### Essential

1. ✔ An existing or creatable exercise/rudiment object with: 
    ``` 
    pattern: RRLL, name: Double Stroke, instrument: drums 
    ```
2. ➖ An ability to create a practice object: 
    ``` 
    exercise: Double Stroke, duration: X, bpm: X, rating: /10 
    ```

3. ❌ An ability to search through existing exercises and choose one to practice.

#### Desirable

4. ❌ An ability to find one's threshold. This would be the highest BPM one can play the exercise with a
10/10 rating (This could be customised to 8/10, 9/10 etc., whichever rating the user deems suitable).

5. ❌ An ability to view previous practices, ideally with a graph which monitors progress, namely, the threshold is graphed, 
and a user can monitor the change of threshold.
